I am [caseydierking](https://www.twitter.com/misteroptimist), a full-stack developer, entrepenur, and mountain biker. 

I currently work at [Lean Technologies](http://www.leantech.com) helping manufacturers manage their shop floor processes with Thrive.

This site is my attempt to document my thoughts as I continue exploring and learning new hobbies.
